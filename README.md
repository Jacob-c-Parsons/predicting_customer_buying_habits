# predicting_customer_buying_habits

Using machine learning to predict customer buying habits. Specifically, using a RandomForest model to predict whether a customer will complete a booking or not an finding the most important features that determine whether or not a booking will be complete.

Workflow involved:
1. importing and cleaning data.
2. performing one hot encoding on categorical data so it can input into the model
3. perform feature extraction and engineering to remove/merge/add features as necessary.
4. train and test the model
5. draw and report insights from the data using the model (top features, model accuracy, recommendations etc.)

All code, results and suggestions/conclusions can be found in the Jupyter notebook.
